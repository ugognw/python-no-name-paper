## Requirements

- Python 3.11+

For a full list of Python dependencies, see the `pyproject.toml` file
(the `dependencies` key under the `project` table).

## Quick Start

To get started, you will need to install the necessary dependencies.
You should have a working Python installation already installed.
Specifically, this project requires Python 3.11 or greater. Since
this project is structured like an ordinary Python package,
you can install it and all of the necessary dependencies like you
would any Python package. Namely, run

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

from the project root (the directory containing this README). Then, to use
the package, do

```python3
import no_name_paper
```
